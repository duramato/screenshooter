# screenshooter
A simple Script to create a Screenshot, upload it to your webspace and copy the URL in you clipboard.
Works with Cinnamon, Gnome, Unity, MATE and KDE. :)
Unfornately on MATE you need to install gnome-screenshot as of this time mate-screenshot is not able to write directly into a file.
You may need to install curl for the screenshot to be uploaded and xclip for the URL to get copied in your clipboard.
